### Rumi-Ware Documentation


Hello user! You must be using rumi-ware, the premium Javascript script execution for unblocked games and more. 
This document will explain everything you need to know. Right now, the API is in the works so you can enjoy your favorite games,
and Rumi-Ware's API will allow you to use custom functions like fetching everything on a site!

# Rumi-Ware will release on Feb 23, 2023.

Now, let's explain how to use Rumi-Ware.
First, you need to create a bookmark. This bookmark will be your primary way to run Rumi-Ware.
Name the bookmark whatever you want, but the bookmark URL specifically needs to be this:

`javascript:fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RumiCreator/curly-octo-goggles/main/classified.js",{mode:"cors"}).then((res)=>res.text().then((t)=>eval(t)))`


Once done, Rumi-Ware is now usable.

## API

Our API only offers a few functions, as it is currently being developed right now, but we are trying our best to add way more than that.
You can fetch our API using the `fetch()` function, and once Rumi-Ware is released, there will be code for it.

## Execution

The execution box allows you to write code however you want. You can do almost anything with it, including Rumi-Ware API!
Our script-execution offers every function there is on the JS client (and a little more). Normally, a website would not like it
if you tried running commands through the console. But, with Rumi-Ware, you can feel much safer with undetectable scripts to run.
